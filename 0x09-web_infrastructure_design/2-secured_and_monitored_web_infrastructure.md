**Q1. For every additional element why you added them?** 
- We added, firewall for every server to protect it from being attacked or exploited
Also, 1 SSL certification for our server www. Foobar.com and 3 monitoring clients to collect logs and send them to our collector sumologic

**Q2. What are Firewalls for**
- Firewalls are used for network security. They act as barriers between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, controlling and monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic to prevent unauthorized access.

**Q3. Why is the traffic served over HTTPS**
- Because data will be transferred in plain text and it will be secured when the data is being encrypted using Transfer Layer Security (TLS)

**Q4. What monitoring is used for**
- If there are any web application performance issues it detects and diagnosis it.

**Q5. How the monitoring tool is collecting data**
- It collects logs from application server, MYSQL Database and Nginx. Log is an automatically generated, time-stamped record of occurrences pertinent to a specific system.

**Q6. Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS**
- One web server may process a thousand requests per second; therefore, I'll keep an eye on it from the network and application level

# ISSUES
1. Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
- because it exposes the decrypted data to potential risks and compromises the end-to-end encryption that SSL provides.

2. Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
- This is so that if you have a bug in one of the serversâ€™ components, the bug will also affect the other servers.

3. Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
- Because if it's down, data can't be uploaded to it or modified, which means some parts of the application won't function.
