## For every additional element, why you are adding it
- We add one server and one balancer
- Adding the server allow us to separate each component (web server, Application server, Database MYSQL) in their own server and having one server with all components to serve as a backup if any of the components or server fails. 
- Each server is being monitored and has a firewall
- We added also an extra load balancer that will assist in handling more traffic across the whole infrastructure
