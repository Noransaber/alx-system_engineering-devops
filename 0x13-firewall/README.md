# More Info
As explained in the web stack debugging guide concept page, telnet is a very good tool to check if sockets are open with telnet IP PORT. For example, if you want to check if port 22 is open on web-02:

`sylvain@ubuntu$ telnet web-02.holberton.online 22`
`Trying 54.89.38.100...`
`Connected to web-02.holberton.online.`
`Escape character is '^]'.`
`SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2.8`

`Protocol mismatch.`
`Connection closed by foreign host.`
`sylvain@ubuntu$``

We can see for this example that the connection is successful: Connected to web-02.holberton.online.

Now letâ€™s try connecting to port 2222:`
`
`sylvain@ubuntu$ telnet web-02.holberton.online 2222`
`Trying 54.89.38.100...`
`^C`
`sylvain@ubuntu$`
`
